## Building for Production

1. Build the project:

   ```

2. Preview the production build:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment.

## Deployment

This project can be deployed to any static hosting service:

- **Vercel**: Connect your GitHub repo for automatic deployments
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop the `dist/` folder or connect your repo
- **GitHub Pages**: Use GitHub Actions to deploy from the `dist/` folder
- **AWS S3**: Upload the `dist/` folder to an S3 bucket with static hosting

### Deploying to Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push this project to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/mstfa13/arabo.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```
2. Go to https://vercel.com and log in
3. Click "New Project" â†’ Import your `arabo` repository
4. Framework preset: Vite
5. Build Command: `npm run build`
6. Output Directory: `dist`
7. Add Environment Variable:
   - Key: `VITE_GOOGLE_SHEETS_URL`
   - Value: (Your Apps Script Web App URL)
8. Deploy

After deployment, test form submission in production and confirm rows appear in Google Sheet.

### Updating Environment Variables on Vercel

If you change the Apps Script URL:
1. Go to Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables
2. Update `VITE_GOOGLE_SHEETS_URL`
3. Redeploy (or trigger a rebuild)

### Local vs Production Behavior
- The `mode: 'no-cors'` fetch prevents reading the response body; success inferred by lack of network error
- Use Chrome DevTools â†’ Network to verify the POST call status (should be 200 / opaque)
